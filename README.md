# Rozvrhář

Rozvrhář is a program for automatically creating an optimal class schedule for a student.
You provide a list of mandatory classes that you want to fit into the schedule and it generates all
feasible variants.

The algorithm is very simple, since we are programming in Prolog, we just have it try all the possibilities.
The schedule is provided in Prolog terms.
